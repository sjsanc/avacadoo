# Avacadoo

Avacadoo is a static site generator for publishing educational material as Markdown documents. It's similar to [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), but adds features such as automatic tooltip generation, topic structuring and interactive plugins for testing knowledge. 

It's currently a WIP!
