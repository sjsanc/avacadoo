# Avacadoo

Avacadoo is a static site generator for publishing educational material in an interactive course structure using Markdown documents. It's similar to [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), but adds features such as automatic tooltip generation, topic structuring and interactive plugins for testing knowledge (flashcards, cloze tests, etc.).
